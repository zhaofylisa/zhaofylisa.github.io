In May 2025, I presented my talk "Distributional Learning Across Contexts: Learning Cantonese Tones in Naturalistic Speech", co-authored with Dr. Jennifer Kuo, at the 3rd International Conference on Tone and Intonation (TAI 2025), held at the Institute for Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich, Germany.

I'm thankful to the International Phonetic Association for supporting my participation with an IPA Student Award, which helped make this international travel possible.
