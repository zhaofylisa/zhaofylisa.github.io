In June 2025, I presented my research titled "Unpredictable Temporal Auditory Feedback Perturbation Induces Lengthening, Not Compensation", co-authored with Dr. Sam Tilsen, at the 5th Biennial Boston Speech Motor Control Symposium (BSMCS‚Äô25), hosted at Boston University.

I was grateful to receive a Student Travel Award from the Boston Speech Motor Control Symposium to support my participation in this event.
