In May 2025, I successfully passed my second qualifying exam and officially advanced to PhD candidacy in Linguistics at Cornell University.

My dissertation is titled *"The Role of Contextual Variation in Learning Cantonese Tones from Naturalistic Speech."*  

My committee consists of Professor Jennifer Kuo (Co-Chair), Professor Marten van Schijndel (Co-Chair), and Professor Samuel Tilsen.
