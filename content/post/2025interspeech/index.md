I’m excited to present my paper "The Role of Contextual Variation in Learning Cantonese Tones from Naturalistic Speech", co-authored with Dr. Jennifer Kuo, at the 26th edition of the Interspeech Conference (Interspeech 2025), held in Rotterdam, The Netherlands from August 17–21.

I look forward to sharing our findings and connecting with fellow researchers in speech science!
